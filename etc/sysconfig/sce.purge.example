# Enter files or directories to purge before squashing SCE during sce-import.
# Ensure there are no spaces before or after entries, leading slash not needed,
# wildcards accepted.
# 
# To activate move this file to /etc/sysconfig/sce.purge or create a new one.
#
# Add /opt/.filetool.lst entry to save any changes:
#   etc/sysconfig/sce.purge
#
# Warning: Although this purge system may result in significantly smaller SCEs,
#          removing required files can break the extension. If problems arise
#          modify this sce.purge file, re-import and re-test the SCE. Although
#          the  sce-import -z  command can be used to ignore this sce-purge file
#          when importing SCEs, running sce-update without the -z option will by
#          default use this sce.purge file again to re-import outdated SCEs.
